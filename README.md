# Crypto-Trading-API---SMA-Bot

## Features
Fetches real-time Bitcoin prices from CoinGecko
Calculates SMA5 (Short-term) and SMA20 (Long-term)
Logs:
1. Latest last 20 bitcoin price values
2. Trade Log
      
Trade Strategy:

    üìà BUY when SMA5 crosses above SMA20

    üìâ SELL when SMA5 crosses below SMA20

    ‚è≥ HOLD if no signal is generated
    ‚úÖ Stores the last 20 prices in a Circular Buffer for efficiency
    ‚úÖ Runs every minute to check for trade signals
    ‚úÖ REST API support for fetching latest price, SMA values, and trade signals
    ‚úÖ Unit & API tests using Jest & Supertest

## Assumptions
1. Only Bitcoin (BTC) is Tracked

Why?

    The API is designed to track multiple coins, but the focus is only on Bitcoin for simplicity.
    The CoinGecko API supports other coins, but adding more requires modifying pollCryptoPrice().

Future Expansion?

    Support for Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc. can be easily added by modifying coinsToTrack in index.js.

## Design Decisions

    1. Apis can track any coin but automatic trade bot is implemented for Bitcoin only.
    2. CoinGecko free api allow data inveral of 5 minutes for free apis, which is used initially.
    3. Then uses circular buffer and latest value every minute
    4. Api seperation from servers initialization for testing.
          In index.js, the server doesn‚Äôt start during tests (require.main === module)
